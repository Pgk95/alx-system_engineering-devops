Issue summary: encountered unexpected performance degradation and critical system crashes shortly after deployment. 38%Users reported significant slowdowns, leading to a negative user experience and a spike in support tickets.

Timeline:

Date: August 1, 2023  Time: 12:00 PM - 4:00 pm


Root Cause: The root cause of the performance degradation and system crashes was traced to an unoptimized database query that was introduced during the last-minute code changes made right before the release. This query caused excessive load on the database server, leading to slow response times and eventual crashes.

Solution: 
To address the immediate issues, a hotfix was deployed on August 2, 2023, at 2:00 AM. The hotfix included an optimized database query and improved error handling. The deployment was successful, and users experienced improved performance and stability.

Corrective Measures:

1, Code Review: Implement a mandatory code review process for all last-minute changes before a release. This will ensure that any potential performance bottlenecks or critical issues are caught and addressed in a timely manner.
2, Load Testing: Enhance the load testing phase in the pre-release cycle to simulate a higher volume of users and traffic. This will help identify and rectify performance issues before they impact the production environment.
3, Monitoring: Strengthen real-time monitoring and alerting mechanisms to promptly detect and respond to any anomalies in system performance. Implement automatic alerts for sudden spikes in resource usage.

Preventive Measures:

1, Continuous Integration (CI/CD): 
Enforce a robust CI/CD pipeline to ensure that all code changes are thoroughly tested and integrated before deployment, reducing the likelihood of introducing last-minute errors.
2, Performance Testing: Introduce comprehensive performance testing as an integral part of the development process. Regularly test the application under varying load conditions to identify and address performance bottlenecks early.
3, Documentation: Maintain up-to-date and comprehensive documentation for the application's architecture, codebase, and deployment procedures. This will aid in troubleshooting and knowledge sharing among team members.
